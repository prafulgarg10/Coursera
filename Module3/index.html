                        A disk is a magnetic storage device which has a number of platters (or
                surfaces). The entire assembly of platters rotates as a unit at high speeds
                (typically 5000-10000 RPM for a fixed disk.) The surface of each platter is
                organised as a concentric group of magnetic tracks on which data can be stored.
                Each track is divided into a number of blocks of fixed size (typically 1024
                bytes) in which the data is stored. A block is the smallest amount of data that
                can be read from or written to the disk in a single I/O operation.
